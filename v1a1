< WHAT IS THI ? >

Define, THI. The Human Imperative is a writing project. By using writing, The Human Imperative will codify human experience in such a way as to maximize the degree of integrated experience in all live Humans. 

What is THI? THI is an attempt to treat Human problems like mathematicians treat math problems. First, we define everything.

THI is up to us to define. See < HELP > and< JOIN > for discussions and options.

Ultimately, We must define everything pertaining to our existence, and then the rest. This is the only conceivable way we can hope to expand our horizons into the inconceivable. It is only by exploring the inconceivable that we will find the clews we need to solve our intractable problems. ( ie light speedlimit c, velocity curve, human nature, etc. )
